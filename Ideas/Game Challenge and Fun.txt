2 Players Roll down a hill and they have to get to the end -

Where is the fun? - 
Player fun and interaction with each other
The constant speed increase from the physic itself
The theme that we are going to choose

where is the Challenge?
The way in which the player avoids what is coming at them
How the players are going to be interacting with each other
How they handle the constant momentum that is coming at them, making it harder and harder to avoid what is coming at them


How to make this game simple, yet fun to play for  the player?
Keep it simple with the one mechanic, but creating a small way in which the player can move or affect the other player
Make ways in which players can create certain blocks to stop the opponant?
Other pathes that each player can take, the steaper paths are faster but others paths yield other rewards
Each player should have simple controls to fit the brief? On e button for jump, and another button for use
The player will have the choice of which path they take, They can drop to a lower floor if they wish.
Generated map each time? Balancing around the length of the maps, This way there is a slight RNG for some players to win
	even though they might be unskilled in someway.
